Hello again ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught Software Engineer since May 2019 who decided to give web development a try and started from absolute zero with nothing but HTML.

My journey started from Frontend, but throughout the years I've come to realize that I love:

- Learning and explaining what happens **behind the scenes**,
- Building software that hides complexities from **other engineers** by providing simple interfaces.

This passion - _implicitly_ - has put me to a path that goes from **dealing with clients** to **dealing with servers and infrastructure**.

Thus, I've been investing my time into learning more about servers since Sep 2022 and server infrastructure since Jan 2024.
I find great joy in learning:

- How everything is connected,
- What we can automate,
- How we can secure and observe our overall infrastructure.

This website is a proof of that.
I built this because I was wondering how I can use a domain name I have and it's a cool idea to have a personal space on the Internet.
That's it.

Ok, not going to drag this so, last words:

Do all of above mean that I'm a perfect engineer? Nah, not in the slightest.

But one thing for sure - I'm having a hell of a fun time on this journey, and now I have a personal place where I can share my perspective.

So f\*cking wonderful. I'll see you around.
