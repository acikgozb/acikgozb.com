A toast, for the very first post! üç∫

I did not want to start talking about stuff without an introduction first. So here it is!

It's been so long since I've been thinking about creating a personal website.
And now it's finally happening.

It's not that I know everything and can't wait to share. Nah, that's not going to happen.

I'm just glad that I've come to a point in my career where I can put out information to the community after consuming it for 5 years, no matter how small or silly the topic is.

I've done this once back in my first job.
I was tasked to teach React and its component architecture to a fellow intern to make him job ready.
The feeling of helping someone to enhance their knowledge was pretty damn amazing.

Interesting enough, as I'm typing in here I feel like the same, even though I know a handful of people will read this post at most.

Hopefully, this place will become a reference for myself and you, the reader.

Before signing off, I would like to thank my family for supporting me no matter what. Without them, I would most certainly not be here today.

Moreover, I would like to thank my beautiful wife for keeping up with me on our journey. I can only imagine how hard it is to keep up with an engineer who writes on a black screen and thinks that's cool.

When I promised to mention her here, she had this big-ass smile on her face.
So here you go, wifey!

This is already getting too long, let's see how it goes. Stay tuned!
