title: "Ping"
summary: "An analysis of one of the most used tools in TCP/IP."
---

If our desire is to become better at managing server infrastructure, we can't ignore the elephant in the room - **Networking**.

However, in today's world, we use lots of abstractions to build software.
When it comes to networking, there is this thing called a _cloud provider_ that lets people rent their own private space on the Internet. Basically, you run _your_ software on _their_ infrastructure.

Whilst we can appreciate the abstractions that make our lives easier, I believe we also should have a fairly high level idea of what happens under the hood, especially when it comes to networking.

So this project is my take on explaining that _high level_ picture through one of the most frequently used tools.

Enter `ping`.

- Concept: _Networking_.
- Goal: _Understanding the big picture_.
- Primary tool: _ping_.
- Repository: [tcp-ip-journey](https://github.com/acikgozb/tcp-ip-journey/tree/main/1-ping)

You can read the analysis [here](https://github.com/acikgozb/tcp-ip-journey/tree/main/1-ping).

I didn't want to duplicate the information to make this post longer and prettier, so this post is mostly a reference to the repository.

However, I do want to say a couple of things:

- The notes provided in the repository are just my understanding of several networking concepts.
  There may be some misunderstandings and if that is the case, I would really like to have a feedback from you.

- There were times when I had to explain a specific concept briefly to not steer too much away from the main topic.
  Therefore, the concepts that are explained in this study are actually much deeper than what they appear to be.

- No AI was harmed during the process.

If you've read the analysis before reading this, I would like to congratulate you!
It's definitely no small feat to read 9 long-ass `.md` files!

It was certainly a fun project for me, and that is why I tried to make it as intriguing as possible without going too much into details.

Thanks for reading!
