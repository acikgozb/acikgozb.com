The main codebase of my personal website, allows me to have a personal bubble on the Internet.

## Architecture

![architecture](./readme-assets/architecture)

When it comes to static websites, there are a lot of _easier_ options to go with, such as:

- Github Pages
- Cloudflare Pages
- AWS Amplify
- \*.. and many more\*\*

If you do _not_ want to deal with the underlying infrastructure of a static website, you can go with the options above and have something up and running quite fast.

As an aspiring Infrastructure Engineer, I believe there is a great learning in here by removing the abstractions and play around with cloud resources directly.
I believe if you feel the same way as I do, you will like this repository.

## Cost

The total cost of this website is the cost of the domain name itself, which is 12$ a year -> 1$ a month.
This project takes advantage of the free plans of Cloudflare and AWS.

I have to say, Cloudflare's free plan is **REALLY** generous, which makes experimenting a lot more fun.
